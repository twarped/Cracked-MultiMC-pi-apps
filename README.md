# Cracked-MultiMC-pi-apps
uses my custom cracked multimc launcher and makes it into an app for pi-apps

The same as Minecraft Java MultiMC, but you don't need to buy minecraft to play, just a microsoft or mojang account. Login to MultiMC, add an instance, click Launch to add all the required assets, let it run all the way to the title screen of Minecraft. Quit Game, then launch offline with a usable username. Don't worry if it says "Play demo". It will still work.

to import this app, go to pi apps settings, import app, and paste this in:
